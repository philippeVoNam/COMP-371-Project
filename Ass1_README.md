## Inputs
- [X] u/j -> scale up/down the models
- [X] w/a/s/d -> move up/down/rotate models
- [X] 1-5 -> select model to move + camera to focus on that model
- [X] arrow keys + home -> rotate the WORLD itself -> camera stays in one location
- [X] p/l/t -> change render type (points/lines/triangle)
- [X] mouse -> pan/tilt camera + zoom in/our

## Known TODO not done
- Q/E inputs to rotate the models are not working as expected:
  - instead of rotating in place, they are rotating relative to the world origin
